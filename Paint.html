                                        <p>Paint has the potential to make a big impact on your workplace. You can add a
                                            fresh coat or switch up the color outside for an exterior refresh. You can
                                            also use paint to create an interior that’s as unique as your company
                                            itself.

                                            No matter the project, there is likely a suitable paint option out there.
                                            Different paints adhere to different materials differently so choosing the
                                            best one will give you long term durability. You can even look at options
                                            that protect your surfaces and provide added benefits. When it comes to
                                            painting commercial businesses, these are the types of paints that we use..

                                            <p>Machinery often comes in standard black or grey hues. Changing up the
                                                color allows you to make it both visually appealing and functional. It’s
                                                important that machinery is painted properly so that the finish is both
                                                long-lasting and doesn’t impact the machine. <br>

                                                A high-quality urethane is usually the best option for painting
                                                machinery. It adheres well and cures to a hardened coating that is
                                                extremely durable. Epoxy can also be used depending on the sheen that is
                                                desired. Either way, the finish will last longer on these high-touch
                                                surfaces than with that of just normal paint. <br>

                                                These systems allow for customizing the coating to your unique needs and
                                                to the type of machinery. Additives can be used to make the coating more
                                                resistant to extreme temperatures, even open flames. Moisture resistant
                                                additives can be helpful in reducing mold and mildew for machinery in
                                                humid or wet environments. The coating can even be adjusted to withstand
                                                exposure to harsh chemicals. <br>

                                                Prep is essential to making sure the coating adheres properly. Machinery
                                                will be meticulously cleaned prior to painting. Machine parts that
                                                should be avoided will be carefully covered to ensure they are
                                                protected. The area around your machinery will also be covered to avoid
                                                any spills and splatters. Then, your machinery will be expertly painted,
                                                resulting in an impressive update to your workplace.</p>

                                            <p>Drywall ceilings just don’t make sense in many spaces. However, open
                                                ceilings with pipes and wiring can be unsightly. Often, painting an open
                                                ceiling is the best option to make it look more presentable.
                                                <br>
                                                Freshening up a dark, dreary ceiling can make a big impact on your
                                                space. Plus, it will make it brighter and easier to illuminate properly.
                                                You may even save on lighting costs.
                                                <br>
                                                A paint that is designed to dry fall is usually the best option for
                                                ceiling applications. It helps avoid any paint that doesn’t stick to the
                                                ceiling from adhering to other surfaces. This allows the paint to be
                                                sprayed upward, creating a more uniform application and coating any
                                                wires and pipes.
                                                <br>
                                                A high-quality dry fall acrylic paint can be a good choice for ceilings.
                                                With options for mildew resistance, it’s ideal for a wide range of
                                                surfaces like metal, PVC, and wood. This makes it ideal for ceilings
                                                with a wide range of materials present. A high-hiding formula ensures
                                                that you receive a uniform finish, despite the varying colors of ceiling
                                                components like wiring and ventilation.

                                                        <p>Unlike traditional oil paints, majority of emulsions are water-based paints with fast-drying characteristics. It’s the popular choice for paint contractors since it’s alkali resistant, rich in texture and has stronger colour retention abilities, making it a long-lasting paint choice. As a homeowner, your biggest advantage with water-based emulsions is that it does not leave an odor and dries quickly. Acrylic emulsions offer your beautiful home resistance to cracking with its versatile and flexible finish through the years.
